Please do not afraid breaking my boundaries. Beyond bouundaries together, better. Do not afraid cannibalization. 
Most important thing to achieve my goal is small but great start. Making a tipping point. That's all about. 

Make something valuable product to users. Not depends on Chicken and Egg problem. Not depends on Network effect. 
Like taking square photo and filtering on instagram or utility for individual people.
