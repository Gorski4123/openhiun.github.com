I think apple is one of the most powerful and trendy design company in the world. I always have been curiosity about 
what's next on design like serief versus san-serief or skeuomorphism versus flat-design.

Well non of this can be ultimate answer but currently in the case of mobile application, 
we love thin font rather than bold and we love san-serief rather than serief.

Let's see apple.com's mainpage for almost 2 decades.
